"@evlog/cli": patch
---

Wire a default telemetry ingestion endpoint (`https://telemetry.evlog.cloud/api/telemetry/ingest`) so `evlog` CLI usage data is actually delivered instead of only buffering locally. This only changes *where* already-consented events go — opt-out (`DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, `EVLOG_TELEMETRY=0`, `evlog telemetry disable`) and the `EVLOG_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` override still work exactly as before.
